A script to enable laptop power saving features for #! & Debian GNU+linux.
Generally speaking, this script should automatically switch powertop's 
"Tunables" which proved to make significant impact in power consumption 
while running on battery.

Script originally created by hardran3 at:

Adjusted to own needs and github'ed by Dawid Lorenz / dawid@lorenz.co

To make this script run each time laptop's power adapter is plugged in/out:
sudo cp powersave /etc/pm/power.d/
sudo chmod +x /etc/pm/power.d/powersave

To run script manually:
./powersave true|false

Tested on Fedora 15, please review script and run it manually before putting
under /etc/pm/power.d/
